DATA:
-----

The dataset contains spike responses from 2 ON and 2 OFF parasol
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in primate retina, stimulated with
full-field binary white noise.  Two experiment performed:
performed consisted of:

-  A long (20-minute) binary stochastic (non-repeating) stimulus,
   which can be used for computing the spike-triggered average (or
   characterizing some other model of the response.
